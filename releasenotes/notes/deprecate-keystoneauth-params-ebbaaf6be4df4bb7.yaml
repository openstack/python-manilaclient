deprecations:
  - |
    Legacy keystoneclient options "use_keyring", "force_new_token"
    and "cached_token_lifetime" were dropped. Using these options
    will have no effect with this release and will cause an error
    in a future release.
security:
  - |
    The use of the keystoneclient library has been replaced with keystoneauth.
    The latter library is better maintained and has more auth options that are
    now usable with manilaclient.
