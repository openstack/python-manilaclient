features:
  - In the 2.84 API version, a new option, ``mount_point_name``, has been
    introduced to the share creation command. This option allow users
    to specify a more intuitive ``mount_point_name`` that will be reflected
    in the share's export location. However, for this feature to be available
    to users, administrators must first enable an extra-spec in the
    share type. In addition, administrators need to set an extra-spec named
    ``provisioning:mount_point_prefix``. The Manila service will combine
    this prefix with the mount point name that user provides during share
    creation. If the ``provisioning:mount_point_prefix`` is not set for
    a share type, but ``mount_point_name_support`` is enabled, the share's
    export location will default to using the project_id as a prefix.
    Please note that shares created with a project_id prefix cannot be
    transferred. To move these shares to a different project,
    an admin must manually unmount them from the current project and mount
    them to the target project. A new capability, ``mount_point_name_support``,
    allows the driver to inform the scheduler about its support for the
    mount_point_name feature.
