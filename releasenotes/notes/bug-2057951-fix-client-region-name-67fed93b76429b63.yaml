    Fixed Bug #2057951: The manila python client previously
    ignored the "region_name" parameter when initializing a
    client session. This caused the client to use wrong API
    endpoint in multi-region deployments. The client now
    correctly respects the "region_name" value ensuring
    requests are routed to the intended region
