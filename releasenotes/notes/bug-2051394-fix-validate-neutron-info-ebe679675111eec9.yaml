    The "openstack share network create" and
    "openstack share network subnet create" commands
    now validate Neutron network information provided
    before sending the request.

    Previously, validation only occured in the Manila service
    which could result in client-side errors when invalid network
    or subnet IDs were supplied. The client now performs
    proper validation and handles missing or invalid
    network data gracefully.
