    Share group and share group snapshots quotas have been available in manila
    since API 2.40. With this change, we added the possibility for users to update
    share group and share group snapshots quotas via the quota class API to the
    manilaclient CLI. For more details, please refer to 
    `Launchpad bug 1871252 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1871252>`_.
