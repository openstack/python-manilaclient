    Fixed an issue where the ``share group update`` command (and the
    underlying ``share_groups.update()`` python binding) was missing
    the experimental API flag. The client now correctly treats this
    action as experimental and sends the required headers. (Bug `2132937
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-manilaclient/+bug/2132937>`_)
