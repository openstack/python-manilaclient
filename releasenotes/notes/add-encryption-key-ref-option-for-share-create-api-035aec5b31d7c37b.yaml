    Starting microversion 2.90, Manila supports 'bring your own key' feature
    that allows user to pass encryption key reference in share creation. The
    encryption key reference must be the UUID of a secret encryption key that
    is stored on a key manager configured in the Shared File Systems service.
    Encryption key reference can belongs to either share or share-server which
    will be decided by storage driver capability and the share type.
    Added 'encryption_keys' per project quota which controls how many share
    and share server encryption keys will be created within project.
