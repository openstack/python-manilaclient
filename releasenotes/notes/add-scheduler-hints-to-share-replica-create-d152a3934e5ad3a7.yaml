features:
  - Added --scheduler_hints to the share-replica create command of manila
    shellclient. In case of OSC, --scheduler-hint is used. Scheduler hints in
    the share-replica create  allow scheduler to select appropriate host using
    filters. For example, user needs to specify "only_host=host@backend#pool"
    when creating a manila share-replica in case of onlyhostFilter. Supported
    for microversion >= 2.67.
