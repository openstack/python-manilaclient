    OpenStackClient is the preferred CLI client supported by this package.
    This CLI client has full feature parity to the legacy "manila" CLI client.
upgrade:
  - |
    Usage of the "manila" CLI client is discouraged in favor of the
    "openstack" CLI. The "manila" CLI client will be removed in a future
    release.
deprecations:
  - |
    The "manila" CLI client is now deprecated. The python-manilaclient
    package provides an openstack CLI plugin. As a replacement, the
    "openstack" CLI must be used. No new features will be added to the
    "manila" CLI client. The "manilalient" SDK/python bindings are not
    affected by this deprecation.
