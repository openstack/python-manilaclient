    Fixed default share type lookup associated with the "openstack share
    create" command. The lookup now resolves default share types correctly
    even on environments where the default type isn't named "default". See
    `launchpad bug #2030686 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/2030686>`_ for more
    details.
