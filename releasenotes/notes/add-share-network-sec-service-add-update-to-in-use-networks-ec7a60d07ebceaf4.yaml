    Added support for updating and adding security services to in use share
    networks. The command ``share-network-security-service-update`` was
    added to the client. Before each of these commands is executed, make
    sure to run the correspondent check command, being either
    ``share-network-security-service-add-check`` or
    ``share-network-security-service-update-check``. These commands will
    check if the desired share network can have security services added or
    updated, based on the cloud support. Also, these commands can be used
    for both to request a check and to check the outcome.
    The command ``share-network-reset-state`` was also implemented in case
    there is need to update the share network ``status`` field.
