    The manilaclient repository now includes a plugin to openstackclient.
    You can use the ``openstack share ..`` command line interface to
    administer the Shared File System service (manila) on any deployment
    alongside using it to provision and manage the life cycle of manila
    resources. Refer to the `official documentation <https://docs.openstack
    .org/python-manilaclient/latest/cli/osc_plugin_cli.html>`_ to find command
    syntax and usage information. You may also view this documentation
    directly in the CLI with ``openstack help share <subcommand>``. For
    example, ``openstack help share create``.
upgrade:
  - |
    With the introduction of the openstackclient integration, we are also
    announcing our intent to deprecate the "manila" shell commands. These
    clients will emit a deprecation warning in a future release, and will
    eventually be removed. We recommend that you transition your workflows
    and tooling to use the "openstack" CLI when using the Shared File
    Systems service (manila) commands. The "manilaclient" SDK is unaffected
    by the introducion of OpenStackClient.
other:
  - |
    The ``openstack share ..`` CLI is usable only with the "v2" API. At this
    time, we have no plans to support its use with the deprecated "v1" API
    provided by the Shared File System service (manila).
  - |
    The ``openstack share ..`` CLI does not yet support API microversion
    negotiation. This means that to use this release of the OpenStackClient
    with older Shared File System API service, users would have to set the
    API version in their environments. This can be done via cloud config
    (specify ``shared_file_system_api_version``) or via shell environment
    ``OS_SHARE_API_VERSION`` or via the CLI overrride:
    ``--os-share-api-version``. Without this override, the client will use a
    `hard-coded API version <https://opendev
    .org/openstack/python-manilaclient/src/branch/stable/zed/manilaclient
    /api_versions.py#L30>`_ to make API requests and this may fail in
    your deployment if the version is unsupported.
