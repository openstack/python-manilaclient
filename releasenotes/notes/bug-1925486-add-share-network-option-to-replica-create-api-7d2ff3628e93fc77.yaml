    `Bug #1925486 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1925486>`_
    Share replica create command does not support share network option and
    manila internally uses parent share's share network. Fixed it to allow any
    share network by providing option ``share-network`` starting with microversion
    '2.72'.
